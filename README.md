Changes Made

Fixed Crossover Logic:

Swapped EMA array indices for buy/sell conditions to correctly detect crossings (previous fast vs. slow, then recent fast vs. slow).
Updated comments and logging for clarity (e.g., "FastEMA[recent]", "FastEMA[older]").


Version Update: Changed to 1.06 to reflect the fix.

Backtesting Instructions

Compile the Code:

Copy the updated code into MetaEditor, save as 1.mq5, and compile (F7). Ensure no errors or warnings.


Run Single-Pass Backtest:

Open Strategy Tester (Ctrl+R).
Select 1.ex5, set Symbol to your broker’s EURUSD (e.g., “EURUSD” or “EURUSD.pro”), Timeframe to M1, Model to “Every tick based on real ticks”, Deposit to 100,000, and Leverage to 1:100.
In the Settings tab, set Optimization to Disabled.
Extend the date range for more data and potential signals (e.g., September 1, 2025, to September 24, 2025, to cover more bars than the short 31-minute period in your PDF).
Enable Visual mode to see trades on the chart (arrows for entries/exits).
Click Start.


Check Journal Logs:

Go to the Journal tab in the Strategy Tester.
Look for:

Initialization: “EA initialized successfully. Symbol: EURUSD, Timeframe: M1”.
EMA values and crossovers: “Buy/Sell crossover detected”.
Trade attempts: “Opening BUY/SELL: Lot=...” and any error codes if trades fail.
Positions: “Open positions - Buy: true/false, Sell: true/false”.


If no crossovers occur, the market may be too flat—try a more volatile period (e.g., around major news like ECB/Fed announcements) or further reduce EMA periods in the Inputs tab (e.g., Fast=2, Slow=8).


Check Results:

In the Results tab, look for trade entries (e.g., buy/sell orders with lots ~5.0 for 1% risk on $100k with 20-pip SL).
In the Graph tab, verify the equity curve shows activity.


If No Trades Still:

Increase MaxSpreadPips (e.g., to 15) if logs show “Spread too high”.
Download more M1 data if “Insufficient bars” or “Failed to copy EMA data” appears.
Test on a demo chart to rule out tester-specific issues.



If trades enter now, great! If not, share the full Journal logs from the new backtest (including any error codes) for further diagnosis. Let me know if you need additions like an RSI filter or time-based trading restrictions.
